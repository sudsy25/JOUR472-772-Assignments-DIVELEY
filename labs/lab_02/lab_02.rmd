## Load libraries and establish settings

```{r}
# Turn off scientific notation
options(scipen=999)

# Load the tidyverse. If you have not installed the tidyverse already, remove the # from the next line and run it first.  
# install.packages('tidyverse')
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
```

## Load Data

Let's keep working with the UMD courses and Maryland campaign expense
data we used in the pre_lab.

```{r}
umd_courses <- read_rds("data/umd_courses.rds")
maryland_expenses <- read_csv("data/maryland_expenses.csv")
```

## Answer questions

**Q1.** How many departments have offered the courses with "Climate" in
the title and at least one seat? Which department has offered the most?
**A1. 32 have at least one seat, Atmospheric has the most with 93 seats**

```{r}
climate_dept <- umd_courses |>
  filter(str_detect(title, "Climate"),
         seats > 0) |>
  group_by(department) |>
  summarise(course_count = n()) |>
  arrange(desc(course_count))
```

**Q2.** Of the departments listed in A1, which one is the most
interesting to you, and why? 

**A2.** I was surprised that there were only
4 climate courses in the geology department, but triple that in
chemistry. I always thought geology and climate worked hand in hand.

**Q3** Which departments offered the most courses in the Fall 2024 term?
And which departments in that term have at least one syllabus posted?
Answer both of those questions and then compare the top five
departments - how are they different?

**A3.** Business and Management, School of Music, Information Studies,
English, and Teaching and Learning Policy and Leadership offer the most
courses in Fall 24. Economics is ranked 14th in course offered, but
jumps to number 2 in departments by syllabus. Teaching and learning
falls to 60th as well.

```{r}
fall24_course <- umd_courses |>
  filter(term == "202408") |>
  group_by(department) |>
  summarise(course_count = n()) |>
  arrange(desc(course_count))

fall24_syllabus <- umd_courses |>
  filter(term == "202408") |>
  filter(syllabus_count > 0) |>
  group_by(department) |>
  summarise(nofsyllabus = n()) |>
  arrange(desc(nofsyllabus))
```

**Q4.** Using the Maryland campaign expenses data, change the datatype
of the expenditure_date column so that it is a date and not a chr,
saving the result as a new dataframe. Then create a new column for the
month based on expenditure_date. Then write code that shows total amount
spent each month by Wes Moore's committee (you'll need to search the
data to find the exact name, and we're not looking in payee_name). Write
a sentence describing the pattern of spending over time.

**A4. Spending increased overtime, starting with 6000, ending up with 735000.**

```{r}
maryland_expenses <- maryland_expenses |> mutate(expenditure_date=mdy(expenditure_date))

wes_monthly <- maryland_expenses |>
  filter(committee_name == "Moore  Wes For Maryland") |>
  mutate(month = floor_date(expenditure_date, "month")) |>
  group_by(month) |>
  summarise(total_spent = sum(amount)) |>
  arrange(month)
```

**Q5.** Using case_when(), create a column in the Maryland expenses data
called `spending_location` indicating whether each record spent money in
Maryland or outside Maryland. For records that are in Maryland, make the
new column's value "In-state" and for all others, make it "Out of
state". Then write code that shows the total amount of money spent in
each category and describe the results. You can do this in one statement
or break it up into two statements (saving the new column to your
dataframe). **A5**

```{r}
```

**Q6.** Choose your own adventure: using either the UMD courses or
campaign expenses data, ask and answer a question that is different than
the previous ones. You can use one of the ones you provided in the
pre_lab. **A6.**
